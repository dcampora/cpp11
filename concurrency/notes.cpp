* Different kind of functions for threads,
functors
...
functions!
member functions (methods)
packaged_task

* What's the difference between decltype and auto?

* Didn't get 19.22.3.4

* Do 19.25.2.3.1, and similar

* Prefer future over condition variables, for when
  there's only one waiting variable

* Things missing:
** Low level data optimisation techniques (look for std::memory_order)
** Atomics
